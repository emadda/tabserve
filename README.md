# Tabserve

[Tabserve](https://tabserve.dev) is a web app that allows you to route a public HTTPS URL to a localhost web server.

It uses a Cloudflare Worker for HTTPS routing (see [worker-tabserve-reverse-proxy](https://github.com/emadda/worker-tabserve-reverse-proxy)).

This repo is for any issues or feature requests related to the web UI.
